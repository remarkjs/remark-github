# Mention

A mention links to a user, organisation, or team.

For example, [**@user**](https://github.com/user), [**@organization**](https://github.com/organization), or [**@organization/team-name**](https://github.com/organization/team-name).

GitHub ignores @mention and @mentions.

Some valid real world examples: [**@a**](https://github.com/a), [**@github**](https://github.com/github), [**@github/security**](https://github.com/github/security).

But this is invalid: @-w.

This is valid: [**@w-w**](https://github.com/w-w).

This used to be valid: [**@w-**](https://github.com/w-)
