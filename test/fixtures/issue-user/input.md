# User@Issue

A user-issue is relative to the project, but relative to the user’s fork.

GitHub’s usernames can contain alphabetical characters and dashes, but can neither begin nor end with a dash. Additionally, the length of a username can be between 1 and 39 characters (both including).

-   This is a valid issue: username#1;
-   So is this: username#123456789.

They work here
username#1

and here
    username#1

This is not a valid, -username#1; but this is w-w#1, and so is w#1 and ww#1, and w-#1 used to be valid.

This is too long: wooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooo#1 (40 character username).
