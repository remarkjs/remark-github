# User\@Issue

A user-issue is relative to the project, but relative to the user’s fork.

GitHub’s usernames can contain alphabetical characters and dashes, but can neither begin nor end with a dash. Additionally, the length of a username can be between 1 and 39 characters (both including).

*   This is a valid issue: [username#1](https://github.com/username/remark/issues/1);
*   So is this: [username#123456789](https://github.com/username/remark/issues/123456789).

They work here
[username#1](https://github.com/username/remark/issues/1)

and here
[username#1](https://github.com/username/remark/issues/1)

This is not a valid, -username#1; but this is [w-w#1](https://github.com/w-w/remark/issues/1), and so is [w#1](https://github.com/w/remark/issues/1) and [ww#1](https://github.com/ww/remark/issues/1), and [w-#1](https://github.com/w-/remark/issues/1) used to be valid.

This is too long: wooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooo#1 (40 character username).
