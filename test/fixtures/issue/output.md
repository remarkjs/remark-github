# Issue

-   This is a valid issue: [#1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1), and so is this: [GH-1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1);
-   So are these: [#123456789](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/123456789), and: [GH-123456789](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/123456789);
-   And these: [gH-1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1), [Gh-1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1), and [gh-1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1).

These will always be a header in pedantic mode (remark requires initial spaces for ATX-headings)
[#1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1)

Or here

But these will always work:
