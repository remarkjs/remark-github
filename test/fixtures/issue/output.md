# Issue

* This is a valid issue: [#1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1), and so is this: [GH-1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1);
* So are these: [#123456789](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/123456789), and: [GH-123456789](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/123456789);
* And these: [gH-1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1), [Gh-1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1), and [gh-1](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/1).

These will always be a header in pedantic mode (remark requires initial spaces for ATX-headings)

Or here

```

But these will always work:
