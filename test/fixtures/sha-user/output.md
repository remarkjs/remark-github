# User\@SHA

A user-SHA is relative to the project, but relative to the user’s fork.

GitHub’s usernames can contain alphabetical characters and dashes, but can neither begin nor end with a dash. Additionally, the length of a username can be between 1 and 39 characters (both including).

*   username\@00000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

And:

*   Prefix [username@`0000000`](https://github.com/username/remark/commit/0000000) suffix;
*   Prefix [username@`0000000`](https://github.com/username/remark/commit/0000000)!;
*   a [username@`0000000`](https://github.com/username/remark/commit/0000000)!;

And what about here
[username@`0000000`](https://github.com/username/remark/commit/0000000)

Or here
[username@`0000000`](https://github.com/username/remark/commit/0000000)

And these SHAs which could also be words? [username@`deedeed`](https://github.com/username/remark/commit/deedeed), and [username@`fabacea`](https://github.com/username/remark/commit/fabaceae).

This is not a valid, -username@[`0000000`](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/commit/0000000); but this is [w-w@`0000000`](https://github.com/w-w/remark/commit/0000000), and so is [w@`0000000`](https://github.com/w/remark/commit/0000000) and [ww@`0000000`](https://github.com/ww/remark/commit/0000000).

This used to be valid: [username-@`0000000`](https://github.com/username-/remark/commit/0000000).

And here’s an example of a disposable e-mail domain, which starts with 7 hexidecimal characters: <username@deadaddress.com>, which shouldn’t match, because there’s no word break after the SHA-like part.

This is too long: wooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooormwooo#0000000 (40 character username).
