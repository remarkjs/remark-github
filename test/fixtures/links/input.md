# GitHub Links

This document tests transformation of links into references.
The behaviour used on GitHub is very lacking. E.g., commit comments
are not actually rendered “properly”, the hash of the URL is literally
shown next to the reference. Another by GitHub unsupported feature is
references for issues, pull requests, or commits on different projects.

remark-github does support all these systems and makes things look
pretty.

## Non-references

An empty link: [this and that]().

A link to GH:
<https://github.com>

A link to a user:
<https://github.com/foo>

A link to a project:
<https://github.com/foo/bar>

A link to a graphs:
<https://github.com/foo/bar/graphs>

A link to a traffic:
<https://github.com/foo/bar/graphs/traffic>
